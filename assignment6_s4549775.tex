\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
	\item I want to publish my article in the "Journal of Computer Science" (http://thescipub.com/journals/jcs).

	In this journal a classical academic layout is customary. This includes an abstract, an intruduction, a body, a conclusion, and then acknowledgements, references, etc.
	\item The goal I want to achieve is getting people interested in computer vision and robotics; and to provide a knowledge basis on which they can further their research nito the subject should they be interested.
	\item The target audience are computer scientists in general. I can assume that they are familiar with basic computer science concepts and terminology. My article is supposed to introduce people into computer vision and its applications ins robotics and should therefore not assume a deep familiarity with any concepts and terms specific to this area.
	\item Computer vision and robotics are important subjects of ongoing research in the current computer science landscape. The barrier of entry in this area can be very high however. People will want to read my article, because it serves as an easy to understand introduction into the subject that will provide a basis for further development.
\end{itemize}
