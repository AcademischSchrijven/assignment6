\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
	\item I want to publish my article in the "Journal of Computer Science" (http://thescipub.com/journals/jcs).

	In this journal a classical academic layout is customary. This includes an abstract, an intruduction, a body, a conclusion, and then acknowledgements, references, etc.
	\item The target audience are computer scientists in general. I can assume that they are familiar with basic computer science concepts and terminology. My article is supposed to introduce people into computer vision and its applications ins robotics and should therefore not assume a deep familiarity with any concepts and terms specific to this area.
\end{itemize}
