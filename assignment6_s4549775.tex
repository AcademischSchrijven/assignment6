\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
	\item I want to publish my article in the "Journal of Computer Science" (http://thescipub.com/journals/jcs).

	In this journal a classical academic layout is customary. This includes an abstract, an intruduction, a body, a conclusion, and then acknowledgements, references, etc.
